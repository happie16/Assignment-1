# INTRODUCTION

Blockstream is a blockchain technology company led by co-founder Adam Back in 2014, headquartered in Victoria, Canada, with offices and staff worldwide. The company develops a range of products and services for the storage and transfer of Bitcoin and other digital assets.

Blockstream has been the leading provider of blockchain technologies and has remained on the forefront of work in cryptography and distributed systems. They have raised $101M to date from investors, including venture capital firms Horizons Ventures, Mosaic Ventures, and AXA Strategic Ventures. 

Blockstream’s mission is to create the financial infrastructure of the future. They build crypto-financial infrastructure based on Bitcoin, the most robust and secure blockchain. Applying cutting-edge cryptography and security engineering, Company is also building the technology that makes financial markets more efficient by reducing reliance on trust. With a long-term outlook on delivering robust and scalable solutions, they invest heavily in research and development to strengthen the Bitcoin ecosystem and protocol. 

They are long-time Bitcoin protocol developers who are convinced that finding an architecturally sound and permissionless way to extend Bitcoin is essential for cryptocurrency to reach its full potential. Bitcoin has inspired people since its inception as a new kind of money in digital form that exists independent of any government or institution. Bitcoin enables financial transactions without needing to trust any third party.

## Purpose: 

Bitcoin’s qualities and potential have encouraged widespread adoption and confidence. However, this necessarily implies a very conservative pace of development for security reasons, and this conservative pace of development means a conservative pace of innovation for Bitcoin as a whole because all users and uses must currently share a single system.

There are many necessary fixes and widely anticipated improvements to Bitcoin that remain unimplemented because of this. These include protocol simplifications, scalability, performance and security improvements, native support for multiple asset types, more expressive transaction types, and privacy and fungibility enhancements.

The altcoin approach of creating a new cryptocurrency just to introduce new features creates uncertainty for everyone looking at cryptocurrencies from the outside. There seems to be no natural stopping point, each fork can be forked again, ad infinitum. This creates both market and development fragmentation. They think that for cryptocurrencies to be successful as a whole we must build network effect, not fragmentation. They believe everyone should enjoy freedom to innovate, too, without seeking permission from us or anyone. 

To accomplish this Blockstream propose technology to enable new cryptocurrency networks that do not need new cryptocurrencies Delivering on this vision will require continued investment in and cooperation with the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole, along with the full-time support of many people with broad and specialized backgrounds. In the Bitcoin ecosystem, and in the world at large, there is a shortage of companies working on trustless cryptographic infrastructure. That’s why they, along with other co-founders who share same vision, came together to establish Blockstream.

Blockstream revealed details related to their massive Bitcoin mining data centers in Quebec, Canada and Adel, Georgia. The facilities account for a combined 300 megawatts worth of energy capacity, and they’re currently available for hosting enterprise-level mining activities, in addition to Blockstream’s own mining operations.

In addition to their mining centers, Blockstream will soon launch the first mining pool with a focus on putting more power back into the hands of individual miners via the BetterHash protocol.

Further, a new application programming interface (API) lets users send encrypted messages to each other from some of the remotest regions on earth and pay for those messages in bitcoin using the Lightning Network, which is designed to open up bitcoin to the higher transaction volumes associated with wider retail adoption.

As bitcoin, now valued at $59 billion, prepares to kick of its tenth year with struggling prices and an uncertain future, the cryptocurrency, dubbed “magic internet money,” has broken free from the internet, and perhaps more importantly, from internet service providers.

Previously, Blockstream had only four satellites broadcasting to North America, South America, Europe, and Africa. With the fifth satellite announced today, Blockstream Satellite will be able to serve the Asia-Pacific region, covering all major landmasses in the world except for Greenland and Antarctica.

In addition to letting users more affordably send smaller bitcoin payments, the newly integrated Lightning Network enables per-kilobyte micro-transactions, and “onion-routing” technology, like that of the Tor browser, allowing users to send messages wherein the sender, receiver, and content all are protected from third-party observation.

Blockstream CEO Adam Back expects the new satellite and API will lead to increased development of smartphone and feature phone applications that link together Blockstream’s GreenAddress bitcoin wallet, its Liquid Network for enabling faster transactions between exchanges, and its Cryptocurrency Data Feed for real-time and historical bitcoin exchange data, developed in partnership with the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of New York Stock Exchange. Because the entire bitcoin blockchain will be broadcast, even miners will be able to use the satellite connection to help generate new blocks and receive bitcoin payments.

Among early users of the bitcoin payments and messaging functionality, Back expects the API will likely be of interest to existing users of mesh networks, which use small antennas like GoTenna to connect mobile phones together without the need for Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, and others. In addition to providing a backup for mesh networks, the new Blockstream Satellite functionality could directly connect these interconnected internet substitutes in isolated regions around the world.

When bitcoin launched in January 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto, the author of the white paper that described the cryptocurrency’s functionality, cited Back’s work on an early centralized cryptocurrency called Hashcash as part of his inspiration.

Nakamoto described bitcoin as “a peer-to-peer electronic cash system,” but as prices have increased to as high as $19,000 (currently $3,400), the vision of bitcoin as a replacement for cash was largely put on hold.

While enterprise adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has increasingly taken place in the form of large hedge funds and their surrounding ecosystems building regulatory-compliant access to bitcoin investment opportunities for high-net-worth investors, others like Blockstream have continued to build out a global payment infrastructure, largely focused on serving the unbanked in developing, or frontier, economies.

In addition to Blockstream’s work, startups like AirTM in Mexico are working to help countries in Latin America’s hyperinflated economies and elsewhere around the world store value in bitcoin. In April 2018, AirTM partnered with the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, the maker privacy-protecting zcash, to make it safer for those in oppressive countries like Venezuela to anonymously use cryptocurrency. In September 2018, venture backed BitPesa announced a partnership with SBI Remit to build a payment corridor between Africa and Japan, making it easier to send money between the regions using the bitcoin blockchain. 

Globally, 1.7 billion people don’t have access to sufficient banking, according to a World Bank estimate from April 2018. Perhaps even more relevant to the Blockstream developments, the nonprofit Web Foundation last month published a report showing that less than half the world’s population had internet access and the rate of growth was slowing.

## Liquid Nerwork - Technology Overview

On October 12, 2015, Blockstream announced the release of its Liquid sidechain prototype which could allow for the transfer of assets between the Liquid sidechain and the bitcoin main blockchain. On October 11, 2018, a production-ready implementation of the Liquid sidechain was officially launched, called the Liquid Network, which is designed to facilitate interoperability between the Bitcoin main chain and the Liquid sidechain to extend Bitcoin’s capabilities.

Blockstream claims that Liquid reduces the delays and friction involved in a normal transfer of bitcoin. Blockstream asserts participating exchanges–including Bitfinex, BitMEX and OKCoin- can reduce counterparty risk for traders and enable near-instant financial transactions between their platform and other exchanges or a trader’s wallet(s). New blocks are added to the Liquid sidechain every minute, as opposed to Bitcoin's 10-minute block interval.

## What is Liquid?

Liquid is a sidechain-based, inter-exchange settlement network linking together cryptocurrency exchanges and institutions around the world, enabling faster Bitcoin transactions and the issuance of digital assets. Liquid is an implementation of Elements, an open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform, based on the Bitcoin codebase.

Liquid provides Bitcoin exchanges and traders with a range of powerful features:

Fast, Final Settlements: Bitcoin moved to the Liquid sidechain (Liquid Bitcoin, “L-BTC”) can achieve final settlement within two minutes.

Confidential Transactions: Amounts and type of asset transacted are hidden by default on Liquid, keeping users’ financial data safe.

Secure Tokenization: New tokens can be issued on the Liquid sidechain (Issued Assets) to represent fiat, securities, or other digital assets.

Interoperability: One Liquid integration provides support for both L-BTC and Issued Assets. All tokens are based on the same standard, allowing users to take advantage of features such as atomic swaps and Bitcoin-style multisig.

Liquid is built using open-source Elements code. This is why you download the application from the Elements repository, execute commands against elementsd (daemon) and elements-cli (client), and edit things like the elements.conf config file.

As the Elements code defaults to using the live Liquid network, we’ll be referring to installing and running Liquid, and not Elements, throughout the docs.blockstream.info site.

# Liquid Uses Cases

## Confidential Transactions

Liquid uses Confidential Transactions, which hides the amounts and asset types within transactions from all third parties. This information is only known by the parties involved in the transaction and other third parties they designate. Liquid transactions use confidential addresses that include a public blinding key and a base address. Only the receiver alone can decrypt the amount sent in a transaction. The receiver can share the private blinding key with any third party in order for that party to be able to validate the amount and asset type.

![confidential_transactions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87047448/130341037-6b4b9b16-bad8-4688-b601-2553239e271b.png)

Liquid transactions include a transaction fee that is used as a denial-of-service protection mechanism. Transaction fees are a minimum value of 0.1 satoshi/vbyte, but can rise if network congestion increases. Liquid transactions are larger than similar Bitcoin transactions due to “range proofs” that must be included in Confidential Transactions and are used to prove that no outputs are negative values.

The implementation of Confidential Transactions in Liquid has important limitations regarding the amounts of transactions that will be protected: amounts are only completely hidden up to a certain maximum. Starting in Elements 0.18.1.6, the default range proof size is 52 bits. This allows for transactions of amounts of 1 sat up to 2^52-1 sats to look identical. Since Elements does not allow any amount to be greater than 21 million * 10^8 sats, all outputs will look identical. Earlier versions of Elements would automatically create larger range proofs for any transaction that required sending more than 687 * 10^8 sats of any asset, which would reveal that a large amount of the asset likely is being sent. Sending more than 21 million * 10^8 sats of an asset requires creating multiple outputs.

## Issued Assets 

Liquid allows for users to create and transfer other assets using a feature called Issued Assets (IA). These assets can enable applications such as tokenized fiat, tokenized non-BTC cryptocurrency, digital collectibles, reward points and attested assets (e.g., gold coins). The obligations under an IA belong to the issuer and Liquid does not verify whether the underlying asset exists or is properly maintained (in contrast to the BTC peg-in procedures).

Issued Assets in Liquid are given a unique identifier (64 hexadecimal characters) when created. This is the only identifying information of the Issued Asset explicitly recorded on the Liquid blockchain. Any additional human readable metadata to ease Issued Assets recognition at the UI level, can be committed to during the issuance, and is published on servers such as the Asset Registry. 

The metadata that can be linked to an asset can be:

- an extended name, 5 to 255 ASCII characters in length (e.g., “IPA pint - liquid. Beer”), to give a human readable name to the Issued Assets
 
- a ticker, 3 to 5 ASCII characters in length (e.g., “IPA”), used to denominate the amounts in a recognizable unit,
 
- the decimal precision, mainly useful for issuers. For instance, 2 places of decimal precision would mean that 199 satoshi of the Issued Asset should be interpreted as 1.99 units of the asset,

-a domain that must be controlled by the issuer (e.g., “liquid. beer”), which is used to tie together all of the above information to the entity that also controls the domain submitted to the registry.

Each asset type can optionally be configured to allow reissuance by generating reissuance tokens when it is created. Assets in Liquid can also be verifiably destroyed by their owner to reduce the supply.

The reissuance tokens are used to prove authority and reissue more of the newly created asset at a later date. These tokens can be set up with a multi-signature scheme generally described as being “m of n”. That means that the reissuance transaction requires a group of “m” keys in order to create new tokens.

Issued Assets can be used for many different purposes, but some of the most commonly requested ones include tokenized fiat, tokenized equities, and tokenized cryptocurrencies.

## Security Tokens

Liquid’s Issued Assets feature allows for the creation of tokens representing tradable financial assets, often referred as securities. These securities can represent things like debt securities (bonds), equity securities (stocks), or derivatives (futures, options, and swaps). The development of securities tokens on Liquid could involve the combination of smart contracts on chain or other off chain techniques. Issuers of security tokens on Liquid would benefit from Liquid’s security, reliability, privacy, and scalability.

Blockstream AMP is an asset management platform that allows users to issue and manage transfer restricted security tokens, assets or tracked assets on the Liquid Network. It works with Blockstream Green to enable the tracking and optional restriction of transfers between users.

## Stablecoins (Tokenized Fiat)

In this scenario, fiat currency is deposited in a bank account and held in trust of an issuer. The issuer generates tokens in Liquid representing the amount of money in that account and distributes the tokens to the depositors of the account. If the owner of one of these tokens wishes to receive fiat currency in return for it, he may redeem through the issuer. The issuer can then destroy the token and maintain an equal supply of fiat currency and outstanding tokens. As more fiat currency is deposited into the account, additional tokens can also be issued by the issuer. The issuer can prove to any auditor or regulator that the number of outstanding tokens always matches the balance of the bank account. Issuers can also choose to use the scripting feature of Liquid to comply with different regulations around the world without adding any artificial requirements to the functionaries.

## Tokenized Cryptocurrencies

While Liquid supports Bitcoin through its Federation, other cryptocurrencies are not natively supported. Very few cryptocurrencies have the track record for stability and security as Bitcoin and it would be risky to include them as part of the consensus rules of the system. Instead, Liquid members can create a token that represents a collateralized cryptocurrency. These tokens can now be traded and settled between Liquid users with the same speed and privacy as Bitcoin and other Issued Assets. This approach also allows exchanges and traders to safely handle these assets without ever needing to support the underlying asset. This removes the amount of work needed to support extra blockchains and clients when supporting other assets. Owners of these tokens could then take the issued token and redeem it from the issuer. This opt-in model allows for users who wish to benefit to work with parties they trust to issue and secure the assets without requiring the entire federation to know about the asset.

![tokenized_cryptocurrencies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87047448/130341038-f7bfd17e-54b3-46c1-b5af-19e3e3ee8de8.png)

## Unique Token and Digital Collectables 

Liquid can be used to track unique items such as ordered prints by an artist or digital collectables like a set of CryptoLions. You can track unique assets using Issued Assets by issuing a single individual token for each individual asset. The issuer would then keep track of the asset ids that are created and provide a registry to help identify which asset is associated with which digital collectable. There is no way to natively categorize or group assets in Liquid, although wallet software could support this use case.

## Allowing Rapid Transfer of Funds

Using Liquid, exchanges may offer the ability for their users to deposit and withdraw funds quickly and privately. To do this, exchanges will hold a portion of funds on the Liquid Network. When a user wishes to deposit on an exchange, they will request a Liquid deposit address to be generated on their behalf by the exchange. The exchange will then generate a unique Liquid deposit address for this customer. The customer will then take this address to another exchange and request a Liquid withdrawal. The sending exchange will deduct the balance of the customer and send the funds through Liquid to the receiving exchange. When the transaction receives two confirmations, the receiving exchange can credit the user’s account without the risk of having a double-spend, typically in less than three minutes from when the original transaction was sent.

## Institutional Traders 

Without Liquid, traders must split their funds allocated on different exchanges in order to take advantage of advantageous situations that may emerge within markets. This leaves the trader open to the risk of losing funds on a compromised exchange and limits the amount that can be traded due to the elongated process of moving funds to another exchange. Moving funds between an exchange can take over an hour, letting trade opportunities potentially slip away.

With Liquid, traders can hold their funds in their own wallet within Liquid and send very quickly to any exchange that supports Liquid deposits to trade within minutes. In this scenario, an exchange sees a trading opportunity at Exchange A and can quickly deposit in around 2 minutes onto an exchange. Once trading is complete, the trader can now move the funds back to their own Liquid wallet or to another exchange. Custodial risk is now moved from a single exchange to the entire Liquid federation.

#Blockstream AMP

Blockstream AMP is an asset management platform that allows users to issue and manage Transfer Restricted Assets or Issuer Tracked Assets on the Liquid Network.

Blockstream AMP is available as an API, allowing integrated into existing systems and providing an easy way to expose end users to the asset capabilities of the Liquid Network. Details of how to obtain an API access token and then use the API can be found in the Blockstream AMP API Tutorial.

The Issuer-Tracked Asset type doesn’t place any restrictions on the recipient and there is no need for the issuer to register users in advance. Ownership can be taken by anyone who receives the asset to their Blockstream Green wallet’s ‘Managed Assets’ account. Transfers of the asset between Blockstream Green users is tracked by Blockstream AMP using the user’s Blockstream Green Account ID (GAID). The issuer can view GAID balances for their asset, while the transactions remain private on the Liquid blockchain.

The Transfer-Restricted Asset type requires that the issuer registers the GAID of any potential owners within Blockstream AMP prior to the user being able to receive or transact it. This asset type can be used to issue and manage security tokens, amongst other things. This asset type also tracks and reports on ownership by GAID.

## What’s new in Blockstream?

Blockstream has just announced Blockstream Energy, a new service for energy producers that offers scalable energy demand using Bitcoin’s innovative proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm. Blockstream Energy utilizes modular mining units (MMUs)—self-contained and remotely operated mining facilities—which enable power producers to sell surplus electricity and maximize energy production efficiency without any exposure to bitcoin price volatility or risk.

“For the first time, energy producers can control and scale demand to meet their supply. This incredibly powerful tool can be used to make existing electrical grids far more efficient while also significantly improving the economics of renewable energy projects,” explained Chris Cook, CIO and head of mining at Blockstream. “Looking ahead, we are very excited to leverage Bitcoin technology to accelerate renewables and anticipate this market to grow and remain coupled."

Blockstream MMUs are deployed to energy production sites to enable highly scalable and dynamically adjustable energy demand. They are plug-and-play, and their ISO-compliant dimensions make them easy to ship globally or between energy production sites. Once on site, MMUs can fill a variety of valuable roles for energy producers, including optimizing energy utilization, balancing electric grids, and improving carbon trading strategies.

By leveraging the Blockstream Satellite network, we can connect, operate, and manage MMUs anywhere on the planet, regardless of how remote the energy site may be. This global capability enables energy producers to tap previously unviable hydro and solar hotspots as well as utilize excess energy at sites isolated from civilian or commercial power infrastructure. By monetizing previously stranded or otherwise wasted energy, Blockstream Energy maximizes ROI for energy producers and enables renewable energy generation facilities to be located in optimal locations.

“Much of the world’s usable renewable sources are concentrated in remote locations where there is little local demand and not much surrounding infrastructure,” said Adam Back, Chief Executive Officer at Blockstream. “By combining Blockstream Energy with our network of satellites, these energy hotspots can be tapped into. We look forward to working with partners to identify some of these areas where stranded energy can be utilized for Bitcoin mining to further incentivize investment in renewables."

The Blockstream Energy launch comes amid a series of notable Blockstream Mining announcements that pursue alternative energy solutions, including a partnership with energy infrastructure multinational Aker and a $5 million open-source, solar-powered Bitcoin mine with Square, Inc. These recent ventures demonstrate how mining bitcoin in conjunction with renewable energy can act as a catalyst in driving clean energy adoption.
